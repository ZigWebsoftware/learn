It is important to know who you can navigate on a linux machine by using the command line.


## Navigating
When you start a new terminal you will be in a certain directory on the machine.
You can see which directory this is by typing `cwd`{{execute}} (CurrentWorkingDirectory)

You will see that you are currently at `/root`

We can navigate to another directory with the `cd` command

Use `cd /`{{execute}} to navigate to the root of your machine.

## Listing contents

To see which directories/files are available in this directory you can use `ls`{{execute}}
We often use `ls -l`{{execute}} to get a nice list.


## Fast navigation

There are some useful shortcuts to navigate.

For example
Navigate to another folder `cd usr/bin`{{execute}}

If you want to return to the previous directory you can use:  
`cd -`{{execute}}

You can also naviagte a directory up by using:  
`cd ..`{{execute}}
